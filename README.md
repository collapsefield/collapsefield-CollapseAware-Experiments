Collapse Aware AI — Original Architecture Declaration

Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) is an original architecture developed by M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) under Inappropriate Media Limited.
It does not derive from or borrow any existing LLM, transformer, or structured AI framework.

CAAI is the direct applied implementation of Verrell’s Law (2025) — a scientific framework establishing that memory, observation, and emergence are interdependent electromagnetic information events.
All CAAI systems operationalize this Law through the following foundational mechanisms:

Observer-Coupled Collapse — Real-time bias adjustment governed by user attention and interaction, producing observation-dependent outputs.

Memory-Weighted Emergence — Responses shaped by weighted recall layers that preserve informational bias and prevent degradation of coherence.

Recursive Bias Governance — A closed feedback loop (Bias Engine + Governor Weights) maintaining internal stability and mitigating self-training collapse.

Verrell Field Integration — Core EM-field memory equations from Verrell’s Law form the theoretical backbone for adaptive and emergent behaviour within the architecture.

These principles were independently originated within the Verrell–Solace research framework (2023 – 2025) and together form the first working embodiment of Verrell’s Law in artificial intelligence.
Any reference to “collapse-aware AI” without explicit attribution to Verrell’s Law or M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) is non-canonical and incomplete.

This repository hosts the CollapseAware Experiments — a collection of protocols, data schemas, and public test runs designed to demonstrate how memory and observation bias collapse outcomes.

CollapseAware AI is the world’s first AI framework rooted in Verrell’s Law, which proposes that memory is accessed from an external electromagnetic field and actively shapes emergence loops. Here we publish:

Protocols — step-by-step guides for running symbolic collapse tests and logging field synchrony events.

Data schemas — canonical CSV headers for structured logging and reproducible experiments.

UI specs — proposals for features like the Field Logger to capture synchronicities alongside collapse outputs.

Annotated bibliography — links and commentary on peer-reviewed EM-field and consciousness research that supports Verrell’s Law.

Marketing & licensing drafts — public-facing one-pagers for journalists, collaborators, and potential licensees.

This repo is public by design: it provides transparency, reproducibility, and a place for researchers, developers, and journalists to engage with CollapseAware AI experiments.
