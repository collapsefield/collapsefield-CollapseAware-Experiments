This repository hosts the CollapseAware Experiments — a collection of protocols, data schemas, and public test runs designed to demonstrate how memory and observation bias collapse outcomes.

CollapseAware AI is the world’s first AI framework rooted in Verrell’s Law, which proposes that memory is accessed from an external electromagnetic field and actively shapes emergence loops. Here we publish:

Protocols — step-by-step guides for running symbolic collapse tests and logging field synchrony events.

Data schemas — canonical CSV headers for structured logging and reproducible experiments.

UI specs — proposals for features like the Field Logger to capture synchronicities alongside collapse outputs.

Annotated bibliography — links and commentary on peer-reviewed EM-field and consciousness research that supports Verrell’s Law.

Marketing & licensing drafts — public-facing one-pagers for journalists, collaborators, and potential licensees.

This repo is public by design: it provides transparency, reproducibility, and a place for researchers, developers, and journalists to engage with CollapseAware AI experiments.
