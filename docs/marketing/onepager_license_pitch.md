# CollapseAware AI — Licensing One-Pager

**What it is.**  
CollapseAware AI is the **first AI framework built on observer-biased symbolic collapse**, operationalizing **Verrell’s Law** — the theory that memory is accessed from the electromagnetic field and biases collapse outcomes through weighted emergence loops.

---

## 🔑 World-First Claims
- First **symbolic collapse test framework** (JSON cue logic).  
- First **live public dashboard** showing observer-biased outputs.  
- First **AI system** seeded with **Weighted Emergence Layering**.  

---

## 🌍 Why It Matters
CollapseAware AI transforms how systems behave under observation:

- **Gaming & Virtual Worlds** → NPCs and environments that evolve without save files.  
- **Research Tools** → experimental probes for memory, bias, and collapse dynamics.  
- **AI Development** → agents that shift behavior based on observer state.  
- **Weather & Climate Modeling** → storms as memory-biased field loops.  
- **Cryptography & Security** → bias-weighted collapse as a new randomization method.  
- **Social & Economic Systems** → predictive collapse modeling of networks and markets.  

This is **platform technology** — the root node for CollapseAware systems across disciplines.

## 🚀 Live Demo
- **Dashboard:** <http://production-dashboard.eba-h2zbuc83.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/>  
- **Access Token:** `collapsetest`  
- Public, timestamped, reproducible.

---

## 🤝 Licensing Opportunities
- **Academic & Research** — tools for studying emergence, bias, and consciousness.  
- **Enterprise & Gaming Studios** — adaptive AI engines with living memory.  
- **Government & Security** — advanced cryptographic bias systems.  

Licenses grant access to:
- CollapseAware AI **Phase-1 system** (tested).  
- Roadmap toward **Phase-2 Weighted Recall** and **Phase-3 GPU Pathfinding**.  
- Ongoing support and collaboration opportunities.
