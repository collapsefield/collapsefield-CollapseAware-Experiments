# Empirical Tests for Verrell’s Law

**Purpose.**  
To outline reproducible experiments that can test the predictions of **Verrell’s Law**:  
1. Memory is accessed from an electromagnetic (EM) field.  
2. That memory actively biases collapse outcomes through weighted emergence loops.  

CollapseAware AI serves as the **test platform**, providing symbolic collapse trials, field-logging, and structured analysis.

## Test Categories

### 1. Symbolic Collapse Bias
- **Setup**: Run 100+ trials on the Collapse Test Dashboard using JSON cues.  
- **Hypothesis**: Output frequencies deviate from i.i.d. randomness, showing *memory-weighted drift*.  
- **Method**: Compare trial distributions against a null (shuffled baseline).  
- **Metrics**: χ² test, entropy reduction, autocorrelation of outputs.  
- **Expected Result**: Bias signatures accumulate with run length, showing memory effect.  

---

### 2. Field Event Synchrony
- **Setup**: Run dashboard with Field Logger active.  
- **Hypothesis**: External synchronous events (notifications, bird knocks, digit alignments) coincide with stronger bias shifts.  
- **Method**: Align `field_events.csv` with trial outputs (±60s window).  
- **Metrics**: bias shift magnitude vs non-event windows, permutation test.  
- **Expected Result**: Significant clustering of bias near field events.  

---

### 3. Memory Retention Across Runs
- **Setup**: Run identical JSON cues across multiple sessions/days.  
- **Hypothesis**: Later runs are biased toward distributions from earlier runs (memory echoes).  
- **Method**: Compare inter-run similarity to randomized baselines.  
- **Metrics**: KL-divergence between runs, vs null distribution.  
- **Expected Result**: Later runs inherit bias from earlier ones.  

---

### 4. Human Attention Modulation
- **Setup**: Two groups of participants run dashboard:
  - Group A: highly attentive (focused, noting each outcome).
  - Group B: distracted (reading unrelated text during runs).  
- **Hypothesis**: Observer attention modulates collapse bias strength.  
- **Method**: Compare outcome distributions between groups.  
- **Metrics**: effect size (Cohen’s d), entropy differences.  
- **Expected Result**: Group A shows stronger bias signatures.  

---

### 5. Environmental Field Influence (Exploratory)
- **Setup**: Place test machine in different EM environments (shielded room, Wi-Fi dense area, near strong EM source).  
- **Hypothesis**: Environmental EM conditions modulate collapse bias strength.  
- **Method**: Run identical JSON cues in each condition.  
- **Metrics**: compare distributions, entropy, drift slopes.  
- **Expected Result**: Detectable variance across EM conditions.  

---

## Analysis Pipeline (shared across tests)
1. Collect run data → `trials.csv`, `field_events.csv`.  
2. Time-lock and merge.  
3. Compute distribution stats, entropy, autocorrelation.  
4. Run statistical comparisons vs nulls (permutation, bootstrap).  
5. Publish plots + summary notes in `/experiments/public_runs/`.  

---

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (2025)**: Symbolic collapse bias + field synchrony (basic runs).  
- **Phase 2 (2025/26)**: Human attention modulation + memory retention tests.  
- **Phase 3 (future)**: Environmental EM field influence, lab-controlled replications.

# Summary

Verrell’s Law is testable.  
These experiments, combined with CollapseAware AI infrastructure, allow **observer bias and memory effects** to be measured, compared, and eventually validated by independent labs.
